# LibraryThing-Search
A simple search app for LibraryThing

This is my first app so please be gentle. 

All you do once installed is enter your LibraryThing username and then scan a book's barcode to enter an ISBN.
Then click the search button to search that ISBN against your LibraryThing library.

A live Internet connection is required for the search to work.

Thanks,
